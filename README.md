Hi,This my Task 2 at Oasis Infobyte,Which was to buid a  portfolio web page is created using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. In the HTML, the <html> tag is the root,the <head> section includes the <title> to name the page and a <link> tag to connect the CSS file, and everything visible is inside the <body>. The body is divided into <header>, <main>, and <footer>. In the header, I used an <h3> tag for my name and a <nav> element with an unordered list <ul>, list items <li>, and links <a> to build a navigation bar that connects to different sections of the page like Home, About, Skills, and Contact. The main part of the page is split into different <section> tags: in the Home section, there are headings <h1>, subtexts <p>, an image using <img>, and clickable links <a> for LinkedIn and GitHub icons. The About section includes another image wrapped in <span>, an <h1> heading, a <p> paragraph about me,and a <button> that opens my resume. The Skills & Credentials section uses another <nav> with lists <ul> and links <a> to show technical and soft skills, and several <span> tags each holding an <img> to display certificates. The Experience section uses a <div>, an <h1> heading, and a <p> paragraph to describe my training. Finally, in the footer, I used the <footer> tag with the Contact section, showing details like phone, email, and LinkedIn using <p>, <a>, and <strong> for highlighting text, plus a copyright line. In the CSS, I applied background colors and text alignment to body, header, main, and footer. Navigation menus are styled using .navbar1 and .navbar2, with rules for <ul>, <li>, and <a> to remove bullets, change font settings, and add hover color effects. I customized <h1> to be bold and large, while <p> has clean fonts and a medium size. The <span> elements around certificates have background colors, margins, and box shadows to make them stand out. Images have their own IDs like #img1 with size, margin, and borders. Finally, the <button> is styled with padding, rounded corners, fonts, and hover effects to make it interactive. Overall, HTML elements like header, nav, section, h1, p, img, ul, li, a, span, div, button, and footer build the structure, while CSS adds design using colors, text styles, spacing, shadows, and hover effects to make the portfolio look clean and professional.
